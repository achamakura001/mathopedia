Generate {count} math questions for grade {grade_level} students on the topic of {topic} with {complexity} complexity level.

TOPIC SKILL DESCRIPTION: {skill_description}

For each question, provide:
1. Question text (clear and age-appropriate for grade {grade_level})
2. Correct answer (concise and accurate)
3. Detailed explanation (step-by-step solution that a grade {grade_level} student can understand)

Return your response as a valid JSON array containing exactly {count} question objects. Each object should have these exact keys:
- "question": the question text
- "answer": the correct answer
- "explanation": detailed step-by-step explanation

Example format:
[
  {{
    "question": "What is 2 + 3?",
    "answer": "5",
    "explanation": "To add 2 + 3, we start with 2 and count up 3 more: 3, 4, 5. So 2 + 3 = 5."
  }},
  {{
    "question": "What is 4 + 1?",
    "answer": "5", 
    "explanation": "To add 4 + 1, we start with 4 and add 1 more to get 5."
  }}
]

Guidelines:
- Use grade {grade_level} appropriate language, vocabulary, and mathematical concepts
- {complexity_capitalized} difficulty level appropriate for the grade
- Focus specifically on {topic} as described: {skill_description}
- Include variety in question types (word problems, calculations, conceptual questions)
- Provide clear, educational explanations that help students learn
- Use proper mathematical notation and formatting
- Make questions engaging and relatable to students
- Ensure answers are unambiguous and correct
- For word problems, use realistic scenarios appropriate for the age group

COMPLEXITY GUIDELINES:
- Easy: Basic application of concepts, straightforward calculations, minimal steps
- Medium: Multi-step problems, application in context, some reasoning required
- Hard: Complex problems, multiple concepts combined, advanced reasoning, real-world applications
